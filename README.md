# SMART_back
This is the backend for the SMART-project at INSA Lyon there the objective is to create game-elements for different HEXAD-player types as well as an algorithm that is going to introduce game-elements to a user based on their main HEXAD-12 type as well as their motivation-score using the SDI.
